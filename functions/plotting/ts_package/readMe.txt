Stacked Time Series Package by Alan Seltzer

Email: aseltzer@ucsd.edu

Summary: The functions in this package allow a user to construct a figure with several time 
series of different variables with different units, all on the same x axis (time, presumably). Each 
variable type is presumably given its own axis. For example, in the case of ice core time series of 
temperature, CO2, CH4, etc., each of these would get its own axis. One might desire to plot 
several ice core records of temperature, in this example. This package allows up to four plots on 
each axis. Therefore, a user could plot the temperature records from e.g. Siple Dome, Vostok, 
and NGRIP all on one axis, and the CO2 records from EDML and WAIS Divide on the axis 
below. Other functions included allow the user to easily switch between axes (setting one to be 
active at a time), generate legends, and plot shaded regions (patches) as is commonly done for 
paleoclimate stacked time series plots (e.g. D/O events and Heinrich events shaded). 
Documentation (comments) in each function’s .m file give more detail and examples, as well as 
the example runnable script.
