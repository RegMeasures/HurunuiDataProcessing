To do:
- [ ] automatically project WetBdy in WetDry2. This will allow cleanWetBdy to be
      included in WetDry2 as well. ImageAnalysis and TestProjectToMap will need 
      updating.
- [ ] make some WetBdy QA and discard the crap!
- [x] plot offset timeseries
- [x] update wave timeseries
- [ ] update Sumner sea level (and baro) timeseries
- [ ] update Hurunui baro timeseries
- [ ] QA plot to check for gaps in photo record
- [ ] Wave data QA plot in TimeseiesAnalysis
- [x] do some QA on Twist
- [ ] fix measureTwist for Feb-March 2017 where X twist goes out of range
