To do:
- [ ] automatically project WetBdy in WetDry2. This will allow cleanWetBdy to be
      included in WetDry2 as well. ImageAnalysis and TestProjectToMap will need 
      updating.
- [ ] make some WetBdy QA and discard the crap!
- [ ] plot offset timeseries
- [ ] update wave timeseries
- [ ] update Sumner sea level timeseries
