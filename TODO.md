To do:
- [x] plot offset timeseries
- [x] update wave timeseries
- [x] do some QA on Twist
- [x] move wetbdy and twist into ShortlistPhotos from Photos
- [ ] automatically project WetBdy in WetDry2. This will allow cleanWetBdy to be
      included in WetDry2 as well. ImageAnalysis and TestProjectToMap will need 
      updating.
- [x] make some WetBdy QA and discard the crap!
- [ ] update Sumner sea level (and baro) timeseries
- [ ] update Hurunui baro timeseries
- [ ] QA plot to check for gaps in photo record
- [x] Wave data QA plot in TimeseiesAnalysis
- [x] fix measureTwist for Feb-March 2017 where X twist goes out of range
- [x] handle multiple returns when looking for offsets
- [x] measure mouth position alongshore
- [ ] output plots to pdf
- [x] improve cleanWetBdy so it removes the artificial edges at the edge of the 
      frame near the camera
- [x] check order of twist measurement, distortion correction, etc
