To do:
- [x] plot offset timeseries
- [x] update wave timeseries
- [x] do some QA on Twist
- [x] move wetbdy and twist into ShortlistPhotos from Photos
- [ ] automatically project WetBdy in WetDry2. This will allow cleanWetBdy to be
      included in WetDry2 as well. ImageAnalysis and TestProjectToMap will need 
      updating.
- [x] make some WetBdy QA and discard the crap!
- [ ] update Sumner sea level (and baro) timeseries

- [ ] handle multiple returns when looking for offsets
- [ ] measure mouth position alongshore
